#ASM

Assembler is done,
only a few changes to make it perfect:
- make sure write has written all requested bytes
- set function as static if not called in an other file

#VM

Work in progress
- option parse (-d/--dump), and usage
- make dump function work for negative values
- champions name can be ".cor" (when asm recieve a file wihtout .s extension)
